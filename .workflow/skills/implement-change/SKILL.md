description: Implement an approved software change against prewritten acceptance tests using the smallest coherent diff. Use after planning and test-first evidence exist and product code must be changed to satisfy them.

# Implement an Approved Change

1. Read the plan, test evidence, repository instructions, and affected code.
2. If a validated test patch is supplied, apply it with `workflow test-patch apply <path>`; do not transcribe or edit it manually. Reproduce the focused failing test before editing when practical.
3. Implement the smallest coherent product-code change that satisfies the acceptance criteria.
4. Preserve public behavior outside the stated scope and follow existing project conventions.
5. Run the focused tests, then relevant lint, typecheck, regression, and build commands.
6. Run `workflow source-check` to reject non-printing control bytes, then run `workflow test-patch verify <path>` after implementation. Inspect the diff for unrelated edits and report files, commands, results, assumptions, and risks.

Do not modify or weaken acceptance tests. If the test and handoff disagree, stop and return the conflict to the planner.

Never paste literal terminal control bytes into source or shell commands. Use language escape syntax for NUL, ESC, DEL, and other non-printing characters.
