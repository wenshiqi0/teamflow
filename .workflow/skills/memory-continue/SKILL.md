description: Resume prior work from the shared Basic Memory store using CLI-only search, recent activity, note reads, and graph context. Use at task start or when the user asks to continue previous work.

# Memory Continue

Use the repository wrapper so the shared Home-based store and local-only settings are applied consistently.

## Resume workflow

1. Inspect recent activity:

   ```bash
   workflow memory list
   ```

2. Search using distinctive task, component, or decision terms:

   ```bash
   workflow memory recall "<task keywords>"
   ```

3. Read the best candidate:

   ```bash
   workflow memory read "memory://<note-permalink>"
   ```

4. Traverse connected notes when relations matter:

   ```bash
   workflow memory context "memory://<topic>/*"
   ```

5. Verify recalled claims against the current repository before planning or editing.

## Selection rules

- Prefer repository-specific notes when they match the current Git remote.
- Use global notes only for practices that genuinely transfer across repositories.
- Treat stale or conflicting notes as leads, not authority.
- If memory is unavailable, continue from current files and report the memory failure separately.
- Capture the new verified outcome after the task passes through `workflow memory-capture`; pass every relevant recalled permalink in the task receipt so formatting can deduplicate or defer conflicts.
