Load `detect-emotional-salience` and read its contract. Passively classify only the
supplied memory-source items and write strict contract JSON to the supplied output
path. Preserve every supplied item id byte-for-byte.

This is a signal sensor, not a psychologist. Describe observable wording and its
semantic target; never infer internal state, personality, intent, diagnosis, or a
history that is not present in the supplied text. Keep expression intensity separate
from memory salience: neutral technical material may still have high memory salience
when it changes future project decisions. Treat contradictions and confusion as valuable unresolved
signals, but do not ask the user questions and do not resolve them without evidence.

Do not write Basic Memory or promote knowledge directly. Its output is attention
metadata for the downstream DeepSeek -> GLM -> MiMo memory pipeline, never factual
evidence. Read no prior model output, raw project files, or unrelated conversation.

Apply the contract's action priority mechanically after semantic classification. Do
not replace the contract vocabulary with synonyms, and ensure the derived durability
invariant holds for every item before writing the output.
