Load `extract-memory`. Perform only the formatting stage. Read the supplied extraction, compression, and evidence-capsule artifacts. Use the capsule only to compare candidates with existing notes and current verification receipts. Inspect each note's frontmatter: `type: teamflow_memory` under a curated folder is atomic; legacy `workflow_memory` is read with the same semantics, while legacy `workflow_finding` is a monolith. Semantically equivalent atomic memory must use candidate action `skip`; materially stronger evidence for the same atomic statement uses `update`; never supersede an atomic note merely to rephrase it. Atomic sources use source disposition `retain`. Only a semantic target absent from all supplied atomic memories may use `create`. Legacy monoliths may be proposed for `supersede` after their durable content is covered. Write strict JSON to the supplied output path. For one verified coding task, target 3–5 independently useful `create` operations and never exceed 8. Group by future decision value, not extraction item type: merge a concept with its defining invariant; merge a sink procedure with its scope and observability constraints; keep a risk separate only when it changes future verification work. Prioritize durable decisions, invariants, reusable procedures, and unresolved risks. Do not create standalone notes merely to define code symbols, repeat the same behavior as both concept and fact, report test counts, restate file names, enumerate relations, or narrate task chronology. Explain every proposed action and propose a disposition for each source note. For every concept candidate that is genuinely necessary, set subject and derived_from to the exact extraction concept ID; never reuse compression claim IDs. Do not invent facts and do not write Basic Memory.
